        "\n",
        "During this activity, the fundamental principles of deep learning were applied to a 70000 images dataset to predict the digit that is represented in each sample, understanding the basic and core structure of a neural network in its purest form, providing insight into how more complex frameworks like Tensorflow and Keras are based.\n",
        "\n",
        "The exercise allowed us to identify the importance of choosing the right hyperparameters for the model, such as number of neurons and mini-batch size, and how these can significantly affect the model's performance and overall results. By fine-tuning these hyperparameters, the accuracy of the model reached over 95%.\n",
        "\n",
        "The reinforcement of the importance of dividing the dataset in training, validation and test set to prevent data leaking was highlighted in this exercise, ensuring the model generealizes properly data that has not been seen.\n",
        "\n",
        "Through the activity, the object-oriented programming style improved programming skills by using classes and more complex plotting and iterations. These programming techniques would be a must in further deep learning projects to be more scalable and maintainable.\n",
        "\n",
        "Overall, this activity not only provided hands-on experience with neural networks and image classification, but also set the standard for future deliverables such as the ASL image recognition activity."
